      The Budget API allows you to create, update, and delete recurring budget
      rules to control your Kubernetes spending. Weekly and monthly budgets can
      be established on workloads to set limits on cost spend, with the option
      to configure alerts for reaching specified budget thresholds via email,
      Slack, or Microsoft Teams.
